## Authentication Model

Two-tier access — no login/signup:

| Role | How it works |
|------|-------------|
| **Creator** | Receives a `creatorHash` (UUID) on room creation. Must store it client-side (e.g. localStorage). Required for delete and draw operations. |
| **Player** | No auth needed. Uses `sessionCode` (6-char public code) to view rooms and subscribe to updates. |

The `X-Creator-Hash` header controls which view you get on GET requests. If present and valid, response includes `creatorHash`. Otherwise, it's omitted.

---

## Draw Modes

Rooms have one of two draw modes, set at creation. The mode determines how numbers are drawn and which WebSocket endpoint to use. **The frontend should adapt its UI based on the room's `drawMode`.**

### MANUAL Mode
The creator **picks which number** to draw. The frontend should show a number board (1–75) where the creator selects a specific number. That number is sent via `/app/add-number` with the `number` field in the payload.

**Creator UI:** Clickable number grid (1–75), already-drawn numbers disabled/highlighted.

### AUTOMATIC Mode
The **server picks a random** undrawn number. The creator just triggers a draw (e.g. a "Draw Next" button). The request goes to `/app/draw-number` with no number in the payload — the server selects one.

**Creator UI:** Single "Draw Next Number" button. No number selection needed.

### Both Modes
- Players see the same view regardless of mode — a live-updating board of drawn numbers.
- The mode is fixed at room creation and cannot be changed.
- All draws broadcast the updated room state to all subscribers via WebSocket.

## REST API

### Create Room

```
POST /api/v1/room
Content-Type: application/json
```

**Request:**
```json
{
  "name": "Friday Night Bingo",
  "description": "Optional description",
  "drawMode": "MANUAL"
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Constraints |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | string | yes | 1–255 chars, unique |
| `description` | string | no | max 255 chars |
| `drawMode` | string | no | `MANUAL` (default) or `AUTOMATIC` |

**Response (200):** Creator view — includes `creatorHash`.
```json
{
  "name": "Friday Night Bingo",
  "description": "Optional description",
  "sessionCode": "A3X9K2",
  "creatorHash": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "drawnNumbers": [],
  "drawnLabels": [],
  "drawMode": "MANUAL"
}
```

**Errors:** `400` validation failure | `409` name already taken

---

### Get Room

```
GET /api/v1/room/{session-code}
X-Creator-Hash: {uuid}          # optional
```

**Response (200):**
- With valid `X-Creator-Hash`: creator view (includes `creatorHash`)
- Without header: player view (`creatorHash` field omitted entirely)

```json
{
  "name": "Friday Night Bingo",
  "sessionCode": "A3X9K2",
  "drawnNumbers": [42, 7, 63],
  "drawnLabels": ["N-42", "B-7", "O-63"],
  "drawMode": "MANUAL"
}
```

**Errors:** `404` room not found

---

### Delete Room

```
DELETE /api/v1/room/{session-code}
X-Creator-Hash: {uuid}          # required
```

**Response:** `200` (no body)

**Errors:** `400` invalid/missing hash | `404` room not found

---

### Reset Room

```
POST /api/v1/room/{session-code}/reset
X-Creator-Hash: {uuid}          # required
```

Clears all drawn numbers for the room. Blocked while a tiebreaker is active. On success, broadcasts the updated `RoomDTO` (with empty `drawnNumbers`) to all WebSocket subscribers on `/room/{sessionCode}`.

**Response (200):** Player view `RoomDTO` with empty `drawnNumbers` and `drawnLabels`.
```json
{
  "name": "Friday Night Bingo",
  "sessionCode": "A3X9K2",
  "drawnNumbers": [],
  "drawnLabels": [],
  "drawMode": "MANUAL"
}
```

**Errors:** `400 TIEBREAK_ALREADY_ACTIVE` tiebreaker is active | `404 ROOM_NOT_FOUND` room not found or wrong hash

**Frontend integration:**
- The existing `/room/{sessionCode}` STOMP subscription automatically receives the reset as a `RoomDTO` with empty `drawnNumbers` — no new topic, no new DTO type.
- Detect the transition (non-empty → empty `drawnNumbers`) and show a "Game was reset" toast to all connected players.
- Show a confirmation dialog on the creator's side before calling — the reset is irreversible.

---

### Update Room Info

```
PATCH /api/v1/room/{session-code}
Content-Type: application/json
X-Creator-Hash: {uuid}          # required
```

Partially updates the room's metadata. Uses PATCH semantics: absent or `null` fields are left unchanged; an empty string (`""`) clears the field. Safe to call during an active tiebreaker.

On success, broadcasts the updated `RoomDTO` to all WebSocket subscribers on `/room/{sessionCode}`.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "description": "New description"
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Constraints |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `description` | string | no | `null`/missing = no change; `""` = clear; otherwise update. Max 255 chars. |

**TypeScript interface:**
```typescript
interface UpdateRoomForm {
  description?: string; // null/missing = no change; "" = clear
}
```

**Response (200):** Player view `RoomDTO` with updated fields.
```json
{
  "name": "Friday Night Bingo",
  "description": "New description",
  "sessionCode": "A3X9K2",
  "drawnNumbers": [42, 7],
  "drawnLabels": ["N-42", "B-7"],
  "drawMode": "MANUAL"
}
```

**Errors:** `400 VALIDATION_ERROR` description > 255 chars | `404 ROOM_NOT_FOUND` room not found or wrong hash

**Frontend integration:**
- The same `/room/{sessionCode}` STOMP subscription receives the updated `RoomDTO` — frontend re-renders the description panel.
- Missing `Content-Type: application/json` body is treated as a no-op update (entity is still saved/TTL reset).

---

### List Players in Room

```
GET /api/v1/room/{session-code}/players
X-Creator-Hash: {uuid}          # required
```

**Response (200):**
```json
[
  {
    "name": "Alice",
    "joinDateTime": "2026-03-28T12:00:00"
  },
  {
    "name": "Bob",
    "joinDateTime": "2026-03-28T12:01:30"
  }
]
```

Returns an empty array if no players have joined yet.

**Errors:** `404` room not found or invalid creator hash

---

### Lookup Rooms by Creator Hashes

```
POST /api/v1/room/lookup
Content-Type: application/json
```

Bulk-resolves a list of `creatorHash` values to their rooms. No auth header — the
hash list in the body is itself the credential (only someone who holds a hash can
resolve it). Use this on app load to rehydrate the creator's "my rooms" list from
`localStorage`.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "creatorHashes": [
    "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "7c9e6679-7425-40de-944b-e07fc1f90ae7"
  ]
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------|
| `creatorHashes` | string[] | no | UUID list. Empty or missing → `[]` response. |

**Response (200):** `List<RoomDTO>` in **creator view** (includes `creatorHash`).
Unknown, stale, or expired hashes are silently skipped — the response only contains
rooms that still exist. Order is not guaranteed to match the request.

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Friday Night Bingo",
    "sessionCode": "A3X9K2",
    "creatorHash": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "drawnNumbers": [42, 7],
    "drawnLabels": ["N-42", "B-7"],
    "drawMode": "MANUAL"
  }
]
```

**Errors:** None expected for normal input. Malformed JSON → `400`.

**Frontend integration tip:** after calling `/lookup`, diff the returned rooms against
your localStorage hash list and **prune any hashes that didn't come back** — those
rooms have expired (24h TTL) or were deleted. This keeps localStorage clean over time.

```typescript
interface RoomLookupForm {
  creatorHashes: string[];
}

// Response is RoomDTO[] (creator view)

// Example pruning flow
async function rehydrateMyRooms() {
  const stored: string[] = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('creatorHashes') ?? '[]');
  if (stored.length === 0) return [];

  const res = await fetch('/api/v1/room/lookup', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ creatorHashes: stored }),
  });
  const rooms: RoomDTO[] = await res.json();

  // Prune stale hashes
  const alive = new Set(rooms.map(r => r.creatorHash!));
  const pruned = stored.filter(h => alive.has(h));
  localStorage.setItem('creatorHashes', JSON.stringify(pruned));

  return rooms;
}
```

---

### Get Room QR Code

```
GET /api/v1/room/{session-code}/qrcode
```

**Response:** `200` with `Content-Type: image/png` — 250x250 PNG binary. No auth required.

**Errors:** `404` room not found

---

### Submit Feedback

```
POST /api/v1/feedback
Content-Type: application/json
```

**Request:**
```json
{
  "name": "Alice",
  "email": "alice@example.com",
  "phone": "555-1234",
  "content": "Love the app!"
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Constraints |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | string | yes | max 100 chars |
| `email` | string | no | valid email format, max 254 chars |
| `phone` | string | no | max 20 chars |
| `content` | string | yes | max 2000 chars |

No authentication required. Email and phone are both optional — anonymous submissions are allowed.

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Alice",
  "email": "alice@example.com",
  "phone": "555-1234",
  "content": "Love the app!",
  "createdAt": "2026-04-06T10:30:00Z"
}
```

Null `email`/`phone` fields are omitted from the response (not included as `null`).

**Errors:** `400` validation error (blank name/content, invalid email format)

**TypeScript interface:**
```typescript
interface FeedbackForm {
  name: string;
  email?: string;
  phone?: string;
  content: string;
}

interface FeedbackMessageDTO {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email?: string;
  phone?: string;
  content: string;
  createdAt: string;
}
```

## WebSocket (STOMP over SockJS)

### Connection

```
Endpoint: /bingo-connect
Protocol: STOMP over SockJS
```

**JavaScript example (SockJS + STOMP.js):**
```javascript
const socket = new SockJS('http://localhost:8080/bingo-connect');
const stompClient = Stomp.over(socket);

stompClient.connect({}, () => {
  // Subscribe to room updates
  stompClient.subscribe('/room/A3X9K2', (message) => {
    const roomDTO = JSON.parse(message.body);
    // roomDTO has same shape as GET response (player view)
  });
});
```

### Subscribe — Room Updates

```
Destination: /room/{sessionCode}
```

Receives a `RoomDTO` (player view) every time a number is drawn or corrected. Same JSON shape as the GET response without `creatorHash`.

---

### Subscribe — Number Corrections

```
Destination: /room/{sessionCode}/corrections
```

Receives a `NumberCorrectionDTO` whenever the GM corrects the last drawn number. Use this to show a toast/notification to players about the correction.

```json
{
  "oldNumber": 42,
  "oldLabel": "N-42",
  "newNumber": 12,
  "newLabel": "B-12",
  "message": "GM changed N-42 to B-12"
}
```

> **Note:** The `/room/{sessionCode}` topic also receives the updated `RoomDTO` when a correction happens — so the board state stays in sync automatically. The `/corrections` topic is an *additional* notification for displaying correction alerts.

---

### Subscribe — Player Joins

```
Destination: /room/{sessionCode}/players
```

Receives a `PlayerDTO` every time a new player joins the room.

```json
{
  "name": "Alice",
  "joinDateTime": "2026-03-28T12:00:00"
}
```

---

### Subscribe — Tiebreaker Updates

```
Destination: /room/{sessionCode}/tiebreak
```

Receives a `TiebreakDTO` on every tiebreaker event (start, each slot draw, finish). Only applicable to AUTOMATIC rooms. A room can have multiple sequential tiebreakers during a game, but only one active at a time.

```json
{
  "status": "IN_PROGRESS",
  "playerCount": 3,
  "draws": [
    { "slot": 1, "number": 42, "label": "N-42" }
  ],
  "winnerSlot": null
}
```

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `STARTED` | Tiebreaker created, no draws yet |
| `IN_PROGRESS` | At least one slot has drawn, but not all |
| `FINISHED` | All slots drawn, `winnerSlot` is set |

---

### Subscribe — Errors (Personal Queue)

```
Destination: /user/queue/errors
```

Receives error responses when a WebSocket send fails. This is a user-specific queue — each client only receives their own errors. Subscribe to this destination immediately after connecting.

```json
{
  "status": 400,
  "code": "NUMBER_ALREADY_DRAWN",
  "message": "Number 42 has already been drawn in this room"
}
```

**JavaScript example:**
```javascript
stompClient.connect({}, () => {
  stompClient.subscribe('/user/queue/errors', (message) => {
    const error = JSON.parse(message.body);
    console.error(`[${error.code}] ${error.message}`);
    // Use error.code to distinguish error types programmatically
  });
});
```

---

### Send — Join Room

}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Constraints |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `session-code` | string | yes | non-blank |
| `creator-hash` | string | yes | must match room creator |

**Result:** Server picks a random undrawn number and broadcasts updated `RoomDTO` to `/room/{sessionCode}`.

---

### Send — Correct Last Number (MANUAL rooms only)

```

**Payload:**
```json
{
  "session-code": "A3X9K2",

**Result:** Replaces the last drawn number. Broadcasts:
1. Updated `RoomDTO` to `/room/{sessionCode}` (board state)
2. `NumberCorrectionDTO` to `/room/{sessionCode}/corrections` (correction notification)

**Errors (via STOMP error frame):** room not found, AUTOMATIC mode room, no numbers drawn, new number out of range, new number already drawn.

| `session-code` | string | yes | non-blank |
| `creator-hash` | string | yes | must match room creator |
| `player-count` | integer | yes | 2–6 |

**Result:** Creates a new tiebreaker session. Broadcasts `TiebreakDTO` with status `STARTED` to `/room/{sessionCode}/tiebreak`.

**Errors:** `404` room not found | `400` not automatic mode, player count out of range | `409` tiebreaker already active

| `session-code` | string | yes | non-blank |
| `creator-hash` | string | yes | must match room creator |
| `slot` | integer | yes | 1-based, max = `playerCount` |

**Result:** Draws a random number from the undrawn pool (excluding other tiebreaker draws) for the given slot. Broadcasts updated `TiebreakDTO` to `/room/{sessionCode}/tiebreak`. When all slots have drawn, the tiebreaker finishes and state is auto-cleared — a new tiebreaker can then be started.

**Errors:** `404` room not found | `400` no active tiebreaker, slot out of range, slot already drawn

---

## Error Response Format

All REST errors return an `ErrorResponse`:

```json
{
  "status": 409,
  "code": "ROOM_NAME_TAKEN",
  "message": "Room already exists."
}
```

For `VALIDATION_ERROR`, the response also includes a `fields` array with per-field details:

```json
{
  "status": 400,
  "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
  "message": "name: must not be blank; description: size must be between 0 and 255",
  "fields": [
    { "field": "name", "code": "NOT_BLANK" },
    { "field": "description", "code": "SIZE" }
  ]
}
```

WebSocket errors are delivered to the personal queue `/user/queue/errors` as an `ErrorResponse` JSON payload. Subscribe to this destination after connecting to receive errors from failed send operations.

| Status | When |
|--------|------|
| `400` | Validation failure, invalid arguments, draw mode mismatch, all numbers drawn, invalid state |
| `404` | Room not found or invalid creator hash |
| `409` | Room name or player name conflict |
| `500` | Unexpected server error |

### Error Code Summary

## Error Catalog

Every error the backend can return, organized by endpoint. Use the **message pattern** to match errors in frontend code and show user-friendly messages.

### REST — Create Room (`POST /api/v1/room`)

| Status | Code | Message | Cause | Suggested UX |
|--------|------|---------|-------|-------------|
| 409 | `ROOM_NAME_TAKEN` | `Room already exists.` | Room with the same name already exists | "A room with this name already exists. Choose a different name." |
| 400 | `VALIDATION_ERROR` | `name: must not be blank` | Name field is empty/missing | Inline field validation — "Room name is required" |
| 400 | `VALIDATION_ERROR` | `name: size must be between 0 and 255` | Name exceeds 255 characters | Inline field validation — "Room name is too long" |
| 400 | `VALIDATION_ERROR` | `description: size must be between 0 and 255` | Description exceeds 255 characters | Inline field validation — "Description is too long" |

> **Note:** Validation errors may combine multiple fields separated by `; ` (e.g. `name: must not be blank; description: size must be between 0 and 255`).

### REST — Get Room (`GET /api/v1/room/{session-code}`)

| Status | Code | Message | Cause | Suggested UX |
|--------|------|---------|-------|-------------|
| 404 | `ROOM_NOT_FOUND` | `not found` | Session code doesn't exist, or invalid creator hash provided | "Room not found — it may have expired or the code is incorrect." |

### REST — Delete Room (`DELETE /api/v1/room/{session-code}`)

| Status | Code | Message | Cause | Suggested UX |
|--------|------|---------|-------|-------------|
| 404 | `ROOM_NOT_FOUND` | `not found` | Session code doesn't exist or creator hash doesn't match | "Room not found or you don't have permission to delete it." |

### REST — Reset Room (`POST /api/v1/room/{session-code}/reset`)

| Status | Code | Message | Cause | Suggested UX |
|--------|------|---------|-------|-------------|
| 400 | `TIEBREAK_ALREADY_ACTIVE` | `Cannot reset the room while a tiebreaker is in progress` | Active tiebreaker is running | "Finish the tiebreaker before resetting the room." |
| 404 | `ROOM_NOT_FOUND` | `Room not found.` | Session code doesn't exist or creator hash doesn't match | "Room not found or you don't have permission to reset it." |

### REST — Update Room Info (`PATCH /api/v1/room/{session-code}`)

| Status | Code | Message | Cause | Suggested UX |
|--------|------|---------|-------|-------------|
| 400 | `VALIDATION_ERROR` | `description: size must be between 0 and 255` | Description exceeds 255 characters | Inline field validation — "Description is too long" |
| 404 | `ROOM_NOT_FOUND` | `Room not found.` | Session code doesn't exist or creator hash doesn't match | "Room not found or you don't have permission to update it." |

### REST — List Players (`GET /api/v1/room/{session-code}/players`)

| Status | Code | Message | Cause | Suggested UX |
|--------|------|---------|-------|-------------|
| 404 | `ROOM_NOT_FOUND` | `Room not found or invalid creator hash` | Session code doesn't exist or creator hash doesn't match | "Room not found or you don't have permission to view players." |

### REST — QR Code (`GET /api/v1/room/{session-code}/qrcode`)

| Status | Code | Message | Cause | Suggested UX |
|--------|------|---------|-------|-------------|
| 404 | `ROOM_NOT_FOUND` | `not found` | Session code doesn't exist | "Room not found." |
| 500 | `INTERNAL_ERROR` | `If the error persists, open a ticket.` | QR code generation failed internally | "Could not generate QR code. Try again later." |

### WebSocket — Join Room (`/app/join-room`)

| Code | Message | Cause | Suggested UX |
|------|---------|-------|-------------|
| `ROOM_NOT_FOUND` | `Room not found with session code: {sessionCode}` | Invalid session code | "Room not found — check the code and try again." |
| `PLAYER_NAME_TAKEN` | `Player name '{playerName}' is already taken in this room` | Duplicate player name in room | "That name is taken. Choose a different name." |
| `VALIDATION_ERROR` | `playerName: must not be blank` | Player name empty | Inline validation — "Name is required" |
| `VALIDATION_ERROR` | `playerName: size must be between 0 and 50` | Player name too long | Inline validation — "Name must be 50 characters or less" |
| `VALIDATION_ERROR` | `sessionCode: must not be blank` | Session code empty | Inline validation — "Session code is required" |

### WebSocket — Manual Draw (`/app/add-number`)

| Code | Message | Cause | Suggested UX |
|------|---------|-------|-------------|
| `ROOM_NOT_FOUND` | `Room not found.` | Invalid session code or creator hash | "Room not found." |
| `DRAW_MODE_MISMATCH` | `This room uses automatic draw mode` | Tried manual draw on an AUTOMATIC room | "This room uses automatic draws. Use the Draw Next button instead." |
| `NUMBER_OUT_OF_RANGE` | `Drawn number must be between {min} and {max}, got: {number}` | Number outside 1–75 range | "Invalid number — must be between 1 and 75." |

### Validation Errors (All Endpoints)

Form validation errors (from `@NotBlank`, `@Size`, `@Min`, `@Max`, `@NotNull`) follow this pattern:

```
fieldName: validation message; fieldName: validation message
```

Multiple field errors are joined with `; `. Parse on `; ` to show per-field errors. Common validation messages:

| Validation | Message |
|------------|---------|
| `@NotBlank` | `must not be blank` |
| `@NotNull` | `must not be null` |
| `@Size(max=N)` | `size must be between 0 and N` |
| `@Min(N)` | `must be greater than or equal to N` |
| `@Max(N)` | `must be less than or equal to N` |

### Catch-All Error

Any unhandled server error returns:

| Status | Code | Message |
|--------|------|---------|
| 500 | `INTERNAL_ERROR` | `If the error persists, open a ticket.` |

This indicates a bug. Log the full response for debugging.

## Game Rules — 75-Ball Bingo

Numbers 1–75 mapped to columns:

| Letter | Range | Example |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **B** | 1–15 | `B-7` |
| **I** | 16–30 | `I-22` |
| **N** | 31–45 | `N-42` |
| **G** | 46–60 | `G-51` |
| **O** | 61–75 | `O-63` |

The `drawnLabels` array in responses uses this format (e.g. `["B-7", "N-42", "O-63"]`).

## Room Expiration

Rooms are **automatically deleted** after 24 hours of inactivity. Any mutation (number draw, player join, etc.) resets the timer. This is server-side only — no frontend action required.

**What this means for the frontend:**
- Long-idle rooms will disappear. If a `GET /api/v1/room/{sessionCode}` returns `404`, the room may have expired.
- Consider showing a "room not found — it may have expired" message instead of a generic 404.
- No keepalive mechanism is needed — normal game activity (draws, joins) resets the expiration automatically.

## Quick Integration Checklist

1. **Create room** → store `creatorHash` in localStorage, `sessionCode` for sharing
2. **Share room** → give players the `sessionCode` (or QR code URL)
3. **Players join** → `GET /api/v1/room/{sessionCode}` (no auth), then send `/app/join-room` via WS
4. **Connect WebSocket** → SockJS to `/bingo-connect`, subscribe to `/room/{sessionCode}`, `/room/{sessionCode}/players`, and `/user/queue/errors`
5. **Draw numbers** → creator sends to `/app/add-number` (manual) or `/app/draw-number` (auto)
6. **Correct last number** → creator sends to `/app/correct-number` (manual rooms only)
7. **All clients** receive real-time updates via `/room/{sessionCode}` subscription
8. **Correction alerts** → optionally subscribe to `/room/{sessionCode}/corrections` for toast notifications
9. **Tiebreaker** (auto rooms) → subscribe to `/room/{sessionCode}/tiebreak`, creator sends `/app/start-tiebreak` then `/app/tiebreak-draw` per slot
10. **List players** → creator calls `GET /api/v1/room/{sessionCode}/players` with `X-Creator-Hash`
11. **Delete room** → `DELETE` with `X-Creator-Hash` when done
